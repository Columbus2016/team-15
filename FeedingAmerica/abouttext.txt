ABOUT
Feeding America partners with major brands and products that are commonly seen in grocery stores across the US, such as General Mills, Con Agra, and Food Lion. Through these partnerships, Feeding America receives donations in the form of meals or a percentage of certain products sales when shoppers purchase these products. 

By logging your purchases, you are competing with others who are also purchasing and logging these items. Feeding America currently uses on-package information to make shoppers aware that a portion of their purchases will benefit the organization and the people they serve, but by sharing your logs on social media you are helping spread awareness. Sharing your logs earns you points, but ultimately helps Feeding America spread their Mission.
