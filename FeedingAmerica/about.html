                <div>Feeding America partners with major brands
                    and products that are commonly seen in grocery
                    stores across the US, such as General Mills, Con
                    Agra, and Food Lion. Through these partnerships,
                    Feeding America receives donations in the form
                    of meals or a percentage of certain products sales
                    when shoppers purchase these products.

                    By logging your purchases, you are competing with
                    others who are also purchasing and logging these
                    items. Feeding America currently uses on-package
                    information to make shoppers aware that a portion
                    of their purchases will benefit the organization
                    and the people they serve, but by sharing your
                    logs on social media you are helping spread
                    awareness. Sharing your logs earns you points,
                    but ultimately helps Feeding America spread their
                    Mission. </div>
